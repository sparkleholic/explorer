## Get started

Ladybug Explorer is a web application that is launched from a deployed Docker image.
Please refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for details on how to install and use Docker.

Below we show two different ways to launch Ladybug Explorer. Each of these options make
Ladybug Explorer accessible on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). If the launching is successful, you should see the logs similar to the following in your shell:

```
Access mode: READ_WRITE
Version of Ladybug: v0.12.2
Deployed server started on port: 8000
```

### Option 1: Using an existing database

To access an existing Ladybug database, you can mount its path to the `/database` directory as follows:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

By mounting local database files to Docker via `-v {path to the directory containing the database file}` and `-e LBUG_FILE={database file name}`, the changes done in the UI will persist to the local database files after the UI is shutdown. If the directory is mounted but the `LBUG_FILE` environment variable is not set, Ladybug Explorer will look for a file named `database.kz` in the mounted directory or create a new database file named `database.kz` in the mounted directory if it does not exist.

The `--rm` flag tells docker that the container should automatically be removed after we close docker.

### Option 2: Start with an empty database with example data

You can also launch Ladybug Explorer without specifying an existing database. Ladybug Explorer comes with
bundled datasets that you can use to explore the basic functionalities of Ladybug.
This is simply done by removing the `-v` flag in the example above. If no database path is specified
with `-v`, the server will be started with an empty database.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

Click on the `Datasets` tab on the top right corner and then: (i) you can select one of the bundled dataset
of your choice from the drow-down menu; (ii) load it into Ladybug by clicking the "Load Dataset" button; and (iii)
finally use Ladybug Explorer to explore it.

### Additional launch configurations

#### Access mode

By default, Ladybug Explorer is launched in read-write mode, which means that you can modify the database. If you want to launch Ladybug Explorer in read-only mode, you can do so by setting the `MODE` environment variable to `READ_ONLY` as follows.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           -e MODE=READ_ONLY \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

In read-only mode, you can still issue read queries and visualize the results, but you cannot run write queries or modify the schema.

#### Buffer pool size

By default, Ladybug Explorer is launched with a maximum buffer pool size of 80% of the available memory. If you want to launch Ladybug Explorer with a different buffer pool size, you can do so by setting the `LBUG_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE` environment variable to the desired value in bytes as follows.

For example, to launch Ladybug Explorer with a buffer pool size of 1GB, you can run the following command.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           -e LBUG_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE=1073741824 \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

#### In-memory mode

By default, Ladybug Explorer is launched in disk-based mode. If you want to launch Ladybug Explorer in in-memory mode, you can do so by setting the `LBUG_IN_MEMORY` environment variable to `true` as follows.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -e LBUG_IN_MEMORY=true \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

In in-memory mode, the database is stored in memory and all changes are lost when the server is shut down even if a database directory is mounted. Also, read-only access mode is not supported in in-memory mode.

#### WebAssembly mode

In WebAssembly mode, Ladybug Explorer is launched with `@ladybugdb/wasm-core`, which runs all the queries directly in browser. If you want to launch Ladybug Explorer in WebAssembly mode, you can do so by setting the `LBUG_WASM` environment variable to `true` as follows.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -e LBUG_WASM=true \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

In WebAssembly mode, the database is stored in the current browser session and all changes are lost when the browser tab is closed or when the tab is refreshed. All other configuration parameters are ignored in WebAssembly mode.

#### Dev builds

If you want to launch Ladybug Explorer with the latest development build of Ladybug, you can do so by using the `dev` tag instead of `latest`.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:dev
```

The `dev` tag is updated daily, approximately two hours after the latest dev build of Ladybug is released.

### Updating Ladybug Explorer

When a new version of Ladybug Explorer is released after the initial launch, re-launching the container WILL NOT automatically update the local image to the latest version. To update the local image to the latest version, you can run the following command.

```bash
docker pull lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

After pulling the latest image, you can re-launch the container with the same command as before.

### Launch with Podman

If you are using [Podman](https://podman.io/) instead of Docker, you can launch Ladybug Explorer by replacing `docker` with `podman` in the commands above. However, note that by default Podman maps the default user account to the `root` user in the container. This may cause permission issues when mounting local database files to the container. To avoid this, you can use the `--userns=keep-id` flag to keep the user ID of the current user inside the container, or enable `:U` option for each volume to change the owner and group of the source volume to the current user.

For example:

```bash
podman run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database:U \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

or,

```bash
podman run -p 8000:8000 \
           -v {path to the directory containing the database file}:/database \
           -e LBUG_FILE={database file name} \
           --userns=keep-id \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

Please refer to the official Podman docs for [mounting external volumes](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#mounting-external-volumes) and [user namespace mode](https://https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#userns-mode) for more information.

## Switching databases at runtime

The **DB** menu in the sidebar lets you switch the active database without restarting the server. Three modes are supported:

- **File-based** — open a database file on the local filesystem
- **In-memory** — temporary database; all data is lost on restart
- **Remote (SSH)** — mount a database from a remote machine over SSH

### Remote (SSH) mode

SSH mode uses `sshfs` to mount the remote directory on the machine running Ladybug Explorer and opens the database from the mount point directly. Changes are written through to the remote machine in real time.

**Requirements on the machine running Ladybug Explorer:**

| Dependency | Required when | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| `sshfs` | Always for SSH mode | `sudo apt install sshfs` or `sudo dnf install fuse-sshfs` |
| `/dev/fuse` | Always for SSH mode | Kernel FUSE module — present by default on most Linux systems |
| `sshpass` | Password authentication only | `sudo apt install sshpass` or `sudo dnf install sshpass` |

Private key authentication does not require `sshpass`.

**Requirements on the remote machine:**

Only an SSH daemon (`sshd`) is needed. No additional software is required.

**When running via Docker**, grant the container access to FUSE:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
           --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
           --device /dev/fuse \
           --rm lbugdb/explorer:latest
```

`sshfs` and (if using password auth) `sshpass` must also be present inside the container image.
